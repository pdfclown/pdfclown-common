0. Definitions

  - The `pdfClown™ logos` are the property of Stefano Chizzolini
    <https://stefanochizzolini.it/> (the Licensor).

  - The `upstream repositories` are the original pdfClown.org SCM repositories
    where the pdfClown™ logo files are hosted.

1. Usage

  The pdfClown™ logos:

  a. shall never be altered

  b. shall never be used outside the context of their upstream repositories.

     Derivative repositories (so-called forks) can retain those logos as long as
     they are operated for contributions (pull requests) to the upstream
     repositories, or for personal unmalicious usage which doesn't alter the
     purpose of the source code; in any other case, derivative repositories shall
     remove those logos in order not to be mistaken for their upstream
     repositories. Furthermore, derivative repositories are strictly prohibited
     from publishing artifacts containing those logos.
