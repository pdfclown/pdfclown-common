# Project Structure

## Filesystem structure

The filesystem structure of pdfClown.org projects SHALL follow [Maven's Standard Directory Layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html).

For clarity, [subproject directory names MUST match the `project/artifactID` element](https://www.sonatype.com/blog/2011/01/maven-tip-project-directories-and-artifact-ids) in their respective pom.xml; the same applies to the `project/name` element:

    <name>${project.artifactId}</name>

## Project Hierarchy

A pdfClown.org project SHALL be defined according to this hierarchy:

![Image](res/images/project-hierarchy.svg)

**Legend:**
- _italic style_ denotes **subprojects with "pom" packaging** (assimilated to abstract classes)
- `<<private>>` stereotype denotes **private artifacts** (i.e., not published, consumed only internally to the project hierarchy)
- `<<public>>` stereotype denotes **published artifacts** (i.e., consumed also externally to the project hierarchy)
- properties represent **declarations** (e.g. `dependencies`, `plugins`)
- solid arrow lines represent **Maven `parent` (inheritance) relationships**, pointing from child to parent
- dashed arrow lines represent **Maven dependencies usage** (import or regular)

&dagger; Currently, because of technical limitations in Maven toolset, it is transitively inherited outside the project (ideally, it should be flattened inside <code>base</code> and not published).

### Rationale

The notorious verbosity of Maven configuration is prone to quickly degenerate into a cluttered mess of plugin and dependency declarations and references. The following guidelines are meant to define a healthy structure, and are at the basis of the hierarchy here-above illustrated:

- **plugin and dependency declarations** MUST be decoupled to take advantage of inheritance and import mechanisms, and MUST be pushed as high as possible in the inheritance hierarchy for appropriate reuse:
  - **plugins** are declared in:
    - `super` — for configuration shared _both internally and externally_ to the project
    - `parent` — for configuration shared _only internally_ to the project
    - `base` — for configuration shared _only externally_ to the project
  - **dependencies** are declared in BOM (Bill of Materials) subprojects only:
    - `bom` — for _dependencies corresponding to subprojects within_ the project hierarchy
    - `deps` — for _all the dependencies_ of the project hierarchy, `bom` inclusive
- **plugin and dependency references** MUST be pushed as low as possible in the inheritance hierarchy
- **artifacts of private subprojects** (like `parent`) are neither installed nor published, implying that the artifacts of their child subprojects MUST flatten them
