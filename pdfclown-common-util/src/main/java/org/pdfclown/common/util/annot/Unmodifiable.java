/**
 * Indicates that the annotated type or type use is unmodifiable.
 * <p>
 * <b>Unmodifiability</b> is about the <i>stability of the externally-observable object state,
 * referenced objects exclusive</i>; it is stricter than {@linkplain UnmodifiableView view
 * unmodifiability} and looser than {@linkplain Immutable immutability}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Externally-observable state</b> comprises values and object references directly associated to
 * the class, and the objects indirectly associated to the class through object references. Mutable
 * private fields which don't influence the externally-observable state are irrelevant (e.g.,
 * defensive copy of arrays and other mutable objects makes them effectively immutable;
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> doesn't affect the
 * externally-observable state).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Due to the intrinsic flexibility of interfaces, <i>the semantics of annotated interfaces are much
 * weaker than annotated classes</i>: whilst the latter extend their unmodifiability to derived
 * classes (any additional state MUST be unmodifiable itself), the former are limited to their own
 * definition (derived interfaces and implementing classes may declare additional state as mutable).
 * Consequently, <span class="important">an object referenced as an unmodifiable interface isn't
 * itself unmodifiable, unless the type exposing that reference is {@linkplain Immutable immutable}
 * or marks its use as unmodifiable</span>. All considered, unmodifiable interfaces are mostly
 * relevant to implementers rather than users, since unmodifiable classes are required to implement
 * only (effectively) unmodifiable interfaces.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: <span class="important">This annotation is NOT inheritable, it MUST explicitly mark each
 * and every applicable type.</span> The rationale, beside the fact that unmodifiability does not
 * extend to derived interfaces, is that clarity should win over succinctness.
 * </p>

 * <li>the annotated class has only unmodifiable state (inherited state is also effectively
 * unmodifiable), whose types may be mutable</li>
 * <li>the annotated class may be final (<b>strong unmodifiability</b>), or not (<b>weak
 * unmodifiability</b>); in the latter case, derived classes MUST honour the unmodifiability
 * themselves</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>interface:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the annotated interface declares only unmodifiable state, whose types may be mutable</li>
 * <li>the parents of the annotated interface are themselves unmodifiable</li>
 * <li>the children of the annotated interface MUST honour the unmodifiability of the inherited
 * interface, but can add mutable state of their own</li>
