/**
 * Indicates that the annotated method is
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">idempotent</a>.
 * <p>
 * Means that an operation can be repeated as often as necessary, without causing unintended effects
 * (with non-idempotent operations, the algorithm may have to keep track of whether the operation
 * was already performed or not).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order for a method to be annotated, its implementation must call only idempotent methods
 * itself.
