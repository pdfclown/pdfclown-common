/**
 * Indicates that the annotated type is immutable.
 * <p>
 * Immutability is stricter than {@linkplain Unmodifiable unmodifiability}.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Requirements</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>class:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the annotated class has only {@code final} fields, which are themselves effectively immutable
 * (eg, defensive copy of arrays and other mutable objects)</li>
 * <li>the annotated class is {@code final} (<b>strong immutability</b>), or not (<b>weak
 * immutability</b>)</li>
 * <li>the parent class of the annotated class is itself immutable</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>interface:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the annotated interface has no member with state-altering semantics (setters or other methods
 * with side effects), and its getters return types which are themselves immutable</li>
 * <li>all the parent interfaces of the annotated interface are themselves immutable</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>

 * @implNote Because of the <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2960">notorious mess</a>
 *           around defunct JSR 305, to avoid bloating dependencies with yet another idiosyncratic
 *           sub-standard set of annotations, the minimalist set in this package is meant to
 *           temporarily substitute them for documentation purposes, until the industry settles on a
 *           clean common standard.
