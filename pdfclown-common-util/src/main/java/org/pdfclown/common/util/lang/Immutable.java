/**
 * Indicates that the annotated type is
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">strongly immutable</a>.
 * <h2>Requirements</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>class:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the annotated class is {@code final}</li>
 * <li>the annotated class complies with the requirements of {@linkplain WeakImmutable weak
 * immutability}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>interface:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the annotated interface has no member with state-altering semantics (setters or other methods
 * with side effects); any semantic detail delegated by parent interfaces must be settled to
 * immutability</li>
 * <li>all the parent interfaces of the annotated interface are themselves immutable (or weakly
 * immutable, if limited to semantic details delegated to derived types)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Strong immutability at interface level is obviously limited to contract: it is
 * implementers' responsibility to honor its semantics (and annotate derived types accordingly).

 * @implNote Because of the <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2960">notorious mess</a>
 *           around defunct JSR 305, to avoid bloating dependencies with yet another idiosyncratic
 *           sub-standard set of annotations, the minimalist set in this package is meant to
 *           temporarily substitute them for documentation purposes, until the industry settles on a
 *           clean common standard.
