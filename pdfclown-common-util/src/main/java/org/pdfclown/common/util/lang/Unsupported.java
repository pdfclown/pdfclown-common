/**
 * Indicates that the annotated method is unsupported, throwing
 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException} any time called.

 * Useful to declare in a strong, machine-readable and semantically unambiguous way that an API
 * member is incompatible with the annotated implementation.

 * @author Stefano Chizzolini
 * @apiNote It is strongly recommended to add a {@code throws UnsupportedOperationException}
 *          declaration to the method signature, and to explain in the documentation, using the
 *          {@code @throws UnsupportedOperationException} javadoc tag, the reason for not supporting
 *          an API member. The documentation should also suggest and link to alternate API, if
 *          applicable; an alternate API often has subtly different semantics, so such issues should
 *          be discussed as well.
